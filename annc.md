    **x** has helped me mostly with **Heresy** when I introduced the 2nd major rework `(v2.0)` of the bot, since he was the person who contributed heavily to it, and helped me deeply with it, so I owe him a bunch of thanks for that, **Heresy** would not be what it is right now had I not met him, he may be annoying and troll sometimes, but he is still a good friend, at least to me, and I appreciate him, regardless if he pisses me off sometimes, he is also the reason why I continue to work on **Heresy**, because even though he stopped working it after `v2.0`, I still get the energy to work on it because of him, and I want to make a bot that's at least decent, something maybe he can call a good bot, considering **Heresy** was a mess when he first saw it, not that it's not now, but it is way better than before
