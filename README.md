- **Q: How can I contribute to the bot?**
  - A: You can join the Support Server and either suggest features, report bugs, or if your interested in the development of the bot, you can request for contributing to the bot, though this probably won't be accepted anytime soon as the bot is still really dependent on just one person and isn't ready for further contributions.
- **Q: Is Heresy Free to use?**
  - A: Yes, Heresy is a free to use bot and doesn't require paymment of any sort (mainly because setting up a payment system for such is not in my interest).
- **Q: Is Heresy Open Source?**
  - A: No, Heresy is not currently open source solely because I would rather wait until the bot is fully developed or at least have a stable release before releasing it publically for open source.
- **Q: Why is Heresy called Heresy?**
  - A: Im not really sure why I chose Heresy, one day I was listening to a song by Freddie Dredd, and at the time I was trying to think of a name for the bot and I came up with Heresy.
- **Q: Do I need to be a member to use the bot?**
  - A: Not necessarily, but if you want to learn more about the bot itself and its commands, you will need to join the support server, which you can find in the bot's profile.
- **Q: Is the bot available to add to your server?**
  - A: Yes, but to get the bot's invite link you will need to join the server as the invite link is currently only available to members of the server.

  - Bot updates such as Hotfixes, New Features, and Bugfixes
