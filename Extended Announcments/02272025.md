## Main Announcement. (Skip this if you read the first and second part of the announcement in the channel)

 I know I make random announcements quite a lot, and honestly I'm sure it gets annoying, and I am sorry for that, but I wanna say something, recently, I have been getting back into regularly working on **Heresy** (The bot), and I have been constantly changing and committing new things, or updated older commands, I don't know exactly what inspired me to do this all of a sudden, but I will say that hopefully this peaks the performance for **Heresy**, I know recently, for about a month, **Heresy** (both the server and bot) have been lacking in both updates, and activity, and I take some blame, most of it, to that, I haven't have as much energy to work on **Heresy** that much, and I lost alot of care for what happens to this server and the bot, but I have all of a sudden gotten the courage and energy to work again on both the bot and server regularly, however, for the server changes won't be obvious that much for now, since most of it is going to the bot, not the server, these changes will be actively updated, and I **WILL** be fixing issues with **Heresy** and patching any issues I find when I or others find them, I want and **WILL** make sure **Heresy** is flawless (I mean in terms of not having issues or bugs), and I will do my best to deliver with what people should expect in a high performance bot, I will be doing this alone and will not be asking or receiving help as I don't want to trouble other people with my needs or issues, additionally I will be trying my hardest to work on it much more often, I mean like, I plan on passing 300-400 commands in the next week, I do actually want to make **Heresy** a good bot, sure it might take a while but I have put in enough effort and time into **Heresy** to the point where I won't give up on it, whether this server dies completely or not, I won't quit working on **Heresy**.

    **x** has helped me mostly with **Heresy** when I introduced the 2nd major rework `(v2.0)` of the bot, since he was the person who contributed heavily to it, and helped me deeply with it, so I owe him a bunch of thanks for that, **Heresy** would not be what it is right now had I not met him, he may be annoying and troll sometimes, but he is still a good friend, at least to me, and I appreciate him, regardless if he pisses me off sometimes, he is also the reason why I continue to work on **Heresy**, because even though he stopped working it after `v2.0`, I still get the energy to work on it because of him, and I want to make a bot that's at least decent, something maybe he can call a good bot, considering **Heresy** was a mess when he first saw it, not that it's not now, but it is way better than before

     Lina, Invra, Blizz, Jasper, and NFS UNO have been my friends for a while, considering I met them way before, well, Lina being the latest, but regardless, they have been good friends of mine and I appreciate them alot and they have been real friends, since i met them, Blizz and NFS UNO I have known way longer, over 2-3 years, all the way when I still played xbox, more specifically Need For Speed, they were good friends and still are, Ochra and Nova are also good friends of mine and while I don't talk to them as much as my other friends their still good friends of mine and I appreciate them as much as my other friends, as for Ken Carson (no, I don't mean the artist), he is also someone I recently met and he's pretty chill for the most part, but he's a lil special, I don't have much to say about him tbh, Sasha, I recently met 10 days prior to making this, and she's also pretty nice and chill, I've made a bit of friends recently and I do appreciate them.

# What I have planned for Heresy.

### The Bot:

I eventually do want to have Heresy be hosted in a different way, as in like a Server, instead of being hosted just on a local machine, because for one It's not the most reliable, and It's a bad idea once the bot's source becomes much bigger in file size, and it starts to take up more space, and it's just a better idea to host a bot on a server, not a local machine, however, I wouldn't mind hosting it on my computer much WHEN I get fiber internet, because once that's installed, my internet speeds will be so much quicker and seamless, so hosting will be flawless regardless of how I host it, if anything I might just get another computer to host it like that on fiber, because that would be seamless, and I could SSH into it and change stuff like that, It's not a bad idea at all, along for commands, I don't have much of an idea of what commands I will add, but I hope to add a bunch more commands, hopefully to get around 300 commands before the 5th of March.

### The Server:

For the server, mostly I just want to get it more active again and make it much better of a server by changing some small things, adding more roles, more perks for boosting, more fun bots and emojis, I really wanna make the server better than it is right now and I hope that I can do that while working on the bot, honestly It might take a while, but I also want to get the server to 1000 members, thats been my goal for a while, hopefully I can get it there, but its not likely,


<sub>Additionally, I will be using Markdown Files, in this repository for stuff like announcements and major things like big changes to Heresy, or new features may be listed in other .md files</sub>
